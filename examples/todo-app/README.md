# IC Auth over HTTP Todo App Example

This example showcases how to use the HTTP Auth libraries to authenticate requests to a canister.

In the [backend](./src/backend), the [ic-http-auth](../../packages/ic-http-auth/) library is used to authenticate requests to the canister.

In the [frontend](./src/frontend), the [`@icp-sdk/http`](../../packages/http-auth-js/) library is used to send signed HTTP requests to the canister.

See the [Run It Locally](../../README.md#run-it-locally) section in the root README for how to run the example.
